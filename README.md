# Sqlite
Hello all , I'm Nandhini
I have created a SQLite database named datamovies ,where in I stored few movie names with the names of lead actor, actress, year of release and the director name.
 And then I used python programming language to establish connection with the database and to  retrieve the data.
 
SYNTAX to establish connection in python :
 
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("database_name")

IDE used : PyCharm  (used to establish connection and retrieve data)

Database : SQLiteStudio (used to create , edit , delete SQLite database)
